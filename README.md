### 🌟 About Me  
I’m a first-year engineering student focused on **building a solid computer science foundation** while actively exploring where I want to go deep.

I’m currently inclined toward **full-stack development**, but I intentionally keep my scope wide — backend systems, hardware-software integration, app development, and AI/ML all interest me. I believe the early years are for **exploration with intent**, not premature specialization.

I value understanding over shortcuts. If I don’t truly know something, I redo it properly — no certificates without competence.
